title: Auto-embed URLs in MDX
description: Learn how to set up and use the Astro Embed integration to automatically convert URLs to rich media embeds in your MDX content.
---

The Astro Embed integration automatically converts URLs in MDX files to embed components.

## Set up

To enable the integration, add it to the `integrations` array in your `astro.config.mjs` file before the `mdx()` integration:

```js ins={3} ins="embeds()"
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';
import embeds from 'astro-embed/integration';

export default defineConfig({
	integrations: [embeds(), mdx()],
});
```

## Usage

With the integration enabled, any isolated URL in an MDX file that matches one of the `astro-embed` component types will be converted to the appropriate component.

For example, MDX like this will render an optimised YouTube player component in place of the URL.

```mdx
---
# src/content/examples/auto-embed.mdx
---

I saw this cool video the other day:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoe-woAhq_k
```

Only URLs on their own line will be converted.
URLs within a paragraph will not be processed.

## Configuration options

The auto-embed integration can be configured by passing an options object in `astro.config.mjs`:

```js {8-10}
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';
import embeds from 'astro-embed/integration';

export default defineConfig({
	integrations: [
		embeds({
			// options
		}),
		mdx(),
	],
});
```

### `services`

import { componentNames } from '../../../../packages/astro-embed-integration/remark-plugin';

**Type:** <code>Record&lt;{componentNames.map(JSON.stringify).join(' | ')}, boolean&gt;</code>

By default, the integration enables matching all supported URL types and components.
This includes the `<LinkPreview>` component which will match any `https://` URL.

To disable one or more services, set them as `false` in the `services` option:

```js {2-4}
embeds({
	services: {
		LinkPreview: false,
	},
}),
```
