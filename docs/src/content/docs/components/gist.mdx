import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Gist } from '@astro-community/astro-embed-gist';

The `<Gist>` component embeds files from a GitHub Gist in Astro projects.

## Usage

The `<Gist>` component generates static HTML for files from a [GitHub Gist](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists).
It uses the HTML markup provided by GitHub and links to GitHub’s CSS for styling, so no client-side JavaScript is required.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Astro" icon="astro">
```astro
---
import { Gist } from 'astro-embed';
---

<Gist id="https://gist.github.com/delucis/0b44f4ff0397767b2416cc981692c346" />
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="MDX" icon="seti:markdown">
```mdx
import { Gist } from 'astro-embed';

<Gist id="https://gist.github.com/delucis/0b44f4ff0397767b2416cc981692c346" />
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The above code produces the following result:

<Gist id="https://gist.github.com/delucis/0b44f4ff0397767b2416cc981692c346" />

## Optional props

In addition to the required `id` prop, the following props are available to customise how the `<Gist>` component renders:

### `file`

**Type:** `string`

You can display only a single file from a multi-file Gist by specifying the `file` attribute with the name of the file to embed.

For example, this is the same Gist as above, but only showing the `README.md` file:

```astro /file=".+"/
<Gist
	id="https://gist.github.com/delucis/0b44f4ff0397767b2416cc981692c346"
	file="README.md"
/>
```

<Gist
	id="https://gist.github.com/delucis/0b44f4ff0397767b2416cc981692c346"
	file="README.md"
/>

## Standalone installation

If you only need the `<Gist>` component, you can install the package directly instead of the main `astro-embed` package:

import { PackageManagers } from 'starlight-package-managers';

<PackageManagers pkg="@astro-community/astro-embed-gist" />

The `<Gist>` component can then be imported as:

```js
import { Gist } from '@astro-community/astro-embed-gist';
```
