# Astro Starter Kit: Component

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── demo/
│   └── src/
│       └── pages/
│           └── index.astro
└── packages/
    └── astro-embed-twitter/
        ├── index.js
        └── package.json
```

This project uses **workspaces** to develop a single package, `@delucis/astro-embed-twitter`, from `packages/astro-embed-twitter`. It also includes a `demo` Astro site for testing and demonstrating the component.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command           | Action                                       |
