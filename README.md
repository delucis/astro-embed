# Astro Embed

Welcome! This project aims to collect easy-to-use and lightweight ways to embed common media into your [Astro](https://astro.build/) site.

[Check out the README for the `astro-embed` package ](packages/astro-embed/README.md)

## 🚀 Project Structure

This project uses a monorepo structure with a separate workspace for each embed type. You’ll find a directory for each service in the [`/packages`](packages) directory.

The Astro site in the [`/demo`](demo) directory can be used to preview the various components and the files in [`/tests`](tests) are used to run automated testing on the components.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command       | Action                                                          |
| :------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install` | Installs dependencies                                           |
| `npm start`   | Starts local dev server for the `demo` site at `localhost:3000` |
| `npm t`       | Run the test suite                                              |
