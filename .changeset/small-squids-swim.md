Drop support for Astro v1. Minimum required version of Astro is now 2.0.0

**⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE** You will need to upgrade Astro to v2 to update to this version. This also means dropping support for Astro-flavored Markdown and `astro-embed` support in `.md` files. You can continue using components in content by [switching to MDX](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/).
